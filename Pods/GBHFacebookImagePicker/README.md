To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

Don't forgot to replace the current Facebook App's ID with your own in the plist file (Open as > Source code). 
Like this :

```
<key>CFBundleURLTypes</key>
<array>
    <dict>
        <key>CFBundleTypeRole</key>
        <string>Editor</string>
        <key>CFBundleURLSchemes</key>
            <array>
                <string>fb<YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID></string>
            </array>
    </dict>
</array>
<key>FacebookAppID</key>
<string><YOUR_FACEBOOK_APP_ID></string>
```

Just in case, for public application (which can be use in the AppStore), you need to send your Facebook's App in review to have user's photos permission.  

## Requirements

* Xcode 8 
* iOS 9.0+ target deployment
* FBSDKCoreKit, FBSDKLoginKit (>= 4.0)
* Facebook Application, see [usage](#usage) for explaination 

## Installation

GBHFacebookImagePicker is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "GBHFacebookImagePicker"
```

## Usage

You need to have set up your application correctly to work with Facebook : https://developers.facebook.com/docs/ios/getting-started

Then, implement the `GBHFacebookImagePickerDelegate` protocol:

```
// MARK: - GBHFacebookImagePicker Protocol

func facebookImagePicker(imagePicker: UIViewController, didSelectImage image: UIImage?, WithUrl url: String) {
    imagePicker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
    // Do whatever you whant with the picked image or url ...
}

func facebookImagePicker(imagePicker: UIViewController, didFailWithError error: Error?) {
    imagePicker.dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
}

func facebookImagePicker(didCancelled imagePicker: UIViewController) {
    print("Cancelled Facebook Album picker")
}
```

Display picker : 

```
let picker = GBHFacebookImagePicker()
picker.presentFacebookAlbumImagePicker(from: self, delegate: self) 
```

## Translation 

GBHFacebookImagePicker is currently write in english. If you need translation for the permission popup (or whatever thing), just add this line in your localized file  :

```
"Pictures" = "<your_translation>";
"Oups" = "<your_translation>";
"You need to allow photo's permission." =  "<your_translation>";
"Allow" = "<your_translation>";
"Close" = "<your_translation>";
"Album(s)" = "<your_translation>";
```
