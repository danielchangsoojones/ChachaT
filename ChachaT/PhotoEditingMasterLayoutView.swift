    //Since I have stackviews within stackViews, I was getting a broken autolayout warning. This was because the stackView didn't know it's horizontal size when this was loaded, so the horizontal stack view spacing (with an Apple-given 1000 priority) was causing ambigious constraints. So, in the Profile storyboard, I had to give the PhotoEditingMasterLayoutView a given width (with a low 250 priority), just so the compiler knew, upon load, that the width wasn't 0. Ask Daniel Jones if you run into the problem of a autolayout problem from this view.
