class PhotoEditingStackView: UIStackView {
    //Purpose: stackViews usually don't have any intrinsic content size, but for the PhotoEditingView, I need to set the intrinsic content size, so other stackViews can calculate it. 
    //This sets the intrinsicContentSize of stackView to the size of its subviews largest intrinsicContentSize
    override var intrinsicContentSize : CGSize {
        var maxSize : CGSize = CGSize.zero
        for subview in arrangedSubviews {

                //the size is greatest in both dimensions(height and width). Technically, all views passed to this stack view should have equal heights/widths, so not technically necessary to check both.
                maxSize = subview.intrinsicContentSize
            }
