//Keeping this model for now because I (Daniel Jones) am kind of dumb. When we got a 100 users, the production app was still using this data model. So, now I have to wait for the users to come back into the app to transfer their tags to the new data model. So, until that happens, we need to keep this data model in the app ;(
