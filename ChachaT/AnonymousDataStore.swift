        //by saving the user into Parse, it sets an objectId for the user after the first save. Otherwise, the user has no objectID until first saved, and there are areas within the app where the objectId is force-casted. Potentially, this could not be fast enough if the user doesn't save faster than they click a certain button, but for now, it is fine. But, honestly, I should just create a totally random objectId. It doesn't really matter, as long as we don't have one that is nil.
